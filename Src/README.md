# Analysis Goal :
To develop a class to train Random Forest on provided dataset with tuning using Hyperopt.

# Conclusion:
The given dataset was analyzed and modelled using Random Forest Model. Hyperparameters were optimized using hyperopt. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in building a learning algorithm model.
