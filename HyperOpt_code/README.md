# Analysis Goal :
To perform hyper-parameter tuning using HyperOpt for SVM model

## Hyperparameter Tuning with hyperopt
Hyperparameter tuning is an important step for maximizing the performance of a model. Hyperparameters are certain values/weights that determine the learning process of an algorithm. Several Python packages have been developed specifically for this purpose. Scikit-learn provides a few options, GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV being two of the more popular options. Outside of scikit-learn, the Optunity, Spearmint and hyperopt packages are all designed for optimization. In this task, we will focus on the hyperopt package.

# Conclusion:
This task is done in a team of 2 students. The given dataset was analyzed and modelled using SVM Model. Hyperparameters were tuned using hyperopt. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in building a learning algorithm model. Best parameters for SVM model are 'C': 13.991786432776268, 'coef0': 2.371507705029048, 'degree': 7.0, 'gamma': 'scale', 'kernel': 'linear'.
