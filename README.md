Testing different algorithms classification with Imbalance class data
=======
# Analysis Goal:

Develop a class to test SVM 

# Conclusion:

This task is done in a team of 2 students. A class has been developed to test the SVM Model.
SVM Model is evaluated using confusion matrix, roc_auc_score, Cohen_kappa_score and plotted
ROC Curve, PR Curve.
