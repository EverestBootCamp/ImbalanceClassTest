# Analysis Goal :
To perform hyper-parameter tuning using HyperOpt for XGboost model

# Conclusion:
This task is done in a team of 2 students. The given dataset was analyzed and modelled using Xgboost Model. Hyperparameters were optimized using hyperopt. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in building a learning algorithm model.
