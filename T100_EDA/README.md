# T100: Perform EDA on imbalance data

## Analysis Goal
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset.

## Conclusion
As per the exploratory data analysis (EDA), the data had 30 numerical independent features and 1 categorical target feature. There are no null values and the data is very imbalanced so we have to apply stratified sampling at later stages. During visualization most of the features were negligibly corelated. Also, by the end of the analysis we applied univariate and multivariate analysis.
