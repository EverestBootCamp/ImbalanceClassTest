  <h1><strong>Objective : </strong></h1>
      <p>To perform unit testing for SVM training class .</p> 


<h2>Unit Testing with Python : </h2>

 
  <p>Unit tesing is testing framework used to test individual units of python application which are associated with functions ,classes  to determine whether they are fit for model or not .It helps developers to identify the defects ,before they go for integration testing.</p>
                            
<h3>Running the Unit tests : </h3>

 <p>  To run the unit test we need to have a  class that takes in the unittest module : class.Then ,add functions that test a specific part of code written in python applications.The unittest module needed to be setup and run the tests. </p>
         
       
  <h4>Testing the class  : </h4>
                      <p> There are two classes in python application to be tested .You will simply import it and have a set up function which will create the object.Performed test on standardscaler that will transform data to center the distribution at ) and scale the variance at 1.And also tested the accuracy oif two classes using benchmark.</p>
